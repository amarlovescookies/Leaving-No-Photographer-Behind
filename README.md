## No Cameraman Left Behind

In this project, we address a universal issue in taking group pictures: leaving out the photographer. Having access to a source image of only the photographer and a target image of the rest of the group, we propose a program that can incorporate both parties into one realistic final output using open-source software, namely NumPy, OpenCV, and PyTorch. The image processing pipeline involves three major steps: (1) image segmentation of person(s), (2) information extraction from the source image, and (3) gradient domain blending. From qualitative tests, our program works well on images with people standing in front of a solid background and with people standing next to each other on the horizontal axis. The final product rivals the results manually produced using Adobe Photoshop software. The program performs suboptimally on images with complex backgrounds, with people standing at different locations in the foreground, and images taken at different angles. Future work can be done to improve the robustness of our program and to combat more edge cases.
